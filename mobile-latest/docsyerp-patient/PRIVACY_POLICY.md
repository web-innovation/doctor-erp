Last updated: 2026-02-17

1. Overview
This Privacy Policy explains how DocsyERP Patient ("the App"), provided by your clinic, collects, uses, stores, and shares personal information. The App allows patients to view and request appointments, access prescriptions, and view billing information.

2. Data Controller / Contact
The data controller is the clinic running the DocsyERP service. For privacy questions, contact your clinic administrator or the email provided in the Play Store listing.

3. Data We Collect
- Account and Authentication: phone number, email (used for OTP delivery), user name.
- Patient Records: patient name, age, gender (if provided), patient ID.
- Appointments: requested dates/times, doctor ID, appointment type, symptoms, notes, status.
- Prescriptions & Billing: prescription items, medicine names/dosage, bill amounts, payment status.

4. How We Use Data

6. Data Storage & Security
- Patient data is stored on the clinic's backend servers. Clinics should secure servers with appropriate measures (TLS in transit, encryption at rest, access controls).

8. Children's Data
- The app is not designed for children under 13. If the app collects data about minors, parental consent procedures must be followed by the clinic.

9. International Transfers
